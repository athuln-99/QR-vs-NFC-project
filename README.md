# QR vs NFC honours project
Within this repository we divided the code by 3 folders for each app (or each pair of apps) that we developed.

## NFC Card Emulation App
Within this directory we have two subdirectories. The "Card Emulation" directory contains the code for our card emulation app.
The directory can be launched as a project using Android Studio. The code for this directory was based off of this repository and was adapted for our specific project:
https://github.com/mohamdaoui/HostCardEmulator

The "Card Reader" directory contains the code for the corresponding card reader app that was made to read our card emulation app from another device.
The directory can also be launched as a project using Android Studio. The code for this directory was based off of this repository and was adapted for ur specific project:
https://github.com/mohamdaoui/SmartCardReader
