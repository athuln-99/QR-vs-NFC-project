# QR vs NFC project
Within this repository, we divided the code into 2 folders for each app (or each pair of apps) that we developed.
The details of the project are detailed in _Honors_project_Report_NFC_vs_QR.pdf_.

## NFC Card Emulation App
Within this directory we have two subdirectories. The "Card Emulation" directory contains the code for our card emulation app.
The directory can be launched as a project using Android Studio. The code for this directory was based off of this repository and was adapted for our specific project:
https://github.com/mohamdaoui/HostCardEmulator

The "Card Reader" directory contains the code for the corresponding card reader app that was made to read our card emulation app from another device.
The directory can also be launched as a project using Android Studio. The code for this directory was based off of this repository and was adapted for ur specific project:
https://github.com/mohamdaoui/SmartCardReader

The check-box window feature on the card reader app was based off this repository and adapted for our specific purposes:
